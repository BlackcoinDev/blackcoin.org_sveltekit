## Contributing Content

Internationalization (i18n) files are stored along side other data and template files.

Most contributers will be concerned with [Pages](https://github.com/danielclough/blackcoin.org_sveltekit/tree/main/src/lib/pages) and may need to serve files from [Static](https://github.com/danielclough/blackcoin.org_sveltekit/tree/main/static).


## Developing

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
